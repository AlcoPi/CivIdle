The produced resources will be stored in the buildings which can be transported into other buildings that need these resources. However, a building's storage space is limited.<br><br>Buildings need <b>workers</b> for transportation and production - you need to build residential buildings like <b>huts</b> to increase the worker population. You can upgrade a building to increase its production and storage.",

And you gain happiness from technologies, wonders and great people. Make sure your workers are happy, otherwise your empire's production will halt.<br><br><b>Wonders</b> are one of a kind building - you can only build one and they cannot be removed once built. Wonders can provide significant boost or unlock new mechanisms.",

      "When you enter a new age, a new <b>great person</b> will be born. You can choose one out of three candidates.<br><br>Great people provide boosts and will be added to your permanent collection. When you reborn, you collect all the great people you've chosen this run, plus some  gone, these permanent great people will remain with you.<br><br><b>Permanent</b> great people can be upgraded by collecting great people from each run.
